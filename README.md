### Links

- Live Site URL: [Room Homepage on Vercel](https://fementor-room-homepage-ialsowalkdogs.vercel.app)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Parcel
- Deployed to Vercel

### What I learned

This was a nice refresher for building a mobile-first layout. Even with previous experience, sometimes it takes time and effort to make elements play nicely together! 

### Continued development

- Would be nice to add some fun transitions to the carousel

### Useful resources

- [CSS filter generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - I used this to color the SVG on hover in carousel links.
